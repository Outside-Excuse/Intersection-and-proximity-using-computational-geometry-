# Intersection-and-proximity-using-computational-geometry-
Using the computational geometry programming technique, build a C++ program that implements the algorithm for determining whether two line segments intersect.
Using the computational geometry programming technique, build a C++ program that implements the algorithm for determining whether two line segments intersect.

Input Format

The program receives a set of  (where  is a multiple of 4) points located on a Cartesian plane, with the format:


Constraints

 is a multiple of 4, and all the points .

Output Format

The output of the program will be a boolean array indicated with True if the pair of line segments (4 points per line) intersect, False otherwise.

The array should be displayed in the standard output.
